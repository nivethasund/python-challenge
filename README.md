## Module 3 Challenge Files

Each folder in this repo contains the following files
- Original data from which the analysis is pulled (.csv)
- The python code used to run each analysis (main.py)
- Text files containing the results of each analysis (analysis.txt)

## PyBank

This script provides the overall financial analysis providing key points in the given data,
 - The total number of months included in the dataset
 - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
 - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Here are some sources used in the coding process,
- For initializing values for changes in "Profit/Losses", I hit a wall in trying to figure out how to skip the value in the first row. I was able to utilize AskBCS to find the solution for that. It seems so obvious when I look at the code now, but oh well!

## PyPoll

This script provides the overall findings of an election poll, and the following were keypoints discovered
The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
